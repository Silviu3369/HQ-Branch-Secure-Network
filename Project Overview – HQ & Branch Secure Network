#  Project Overview – HQ & Branch Secure Network

## Objective
This project simulates a secure **HQ ↔ Branch enterprise network** using Cisco ASA firewalls, core switches, and a full range of enterprise services.  
The design integrates **redundancy, routing, security policies, and VPN connectivity**.

---

## HQ Campus
- **ASA-HQ Firewall**
  - Outside: 203.0.113.1/30
  - Inside-MS1: 10.1.1.2/30
  - Inside-MS2: 10.1.1.6/30
  - DMZ: 192.168.10.1/24
  - NAT (dynamic PAT for VLANs, static for DMZ servers)
  - ACLs controlling inbound access
  - OSPF + default-information originate
  - IPSec VPN HQ ↔ Branch
  - SSH restricted to Management VLAN (192.168.60.0/24)

- **Core Switches HQ (MS1-HQ, MS2-HQ)**
  - VLANs 20 (Engineers), 30 (Office), 40 (Sales), 50 (IT), 60 (Management)
  - HSRP redundancy (.1 as virtual gateway)
  - EtherChannel between cores
  - Trunking to access switches
  - OSPF advertising all VLANs
  - DHCP relay (to HQ DHCP server)

- **DMZ Servers**
  - DNS
  - DHCP (HQ scope)
  - Web Server
  - Email Server
  - FTP/NTP Server

## Branch Campus
- **ASA-Branch Firewall**
  - Outside: 203.0.113.5/30
  - Inside-MS1: 10.1.2.2/30
  - Inside-MS2: 10.1.2.6/30
  - NAT (PAT for VLANs, static if needed)
  - ACLs
  - OSPF
  - IPSec VPN HQ ↔ Branch
  - SSH restricted to Management VLAN (172.16.60.0/24)

- **Core Switches Branch (MS1-Branch, MS2-Branch)**
  - VLANs 70 (Marketing), 80 (Office), 90 (Sales), 60 (Management)
  - HSRP redundancy (.1 as virtual gateway)
  - EtherChannel between cores
  - Trunking to access switches
  - OSPF advertising all VLANs
  - DHCP relay (to Branch DHCP server)

- **Branch Servers**
  - DHCP (Branch scope)

---

## Security & Policies
- **NAT**: Inside → Outside PAT, DMZ servers with static NAT
- **ACLs**: Outside-in access restricted to allowed services (HTTP, SMTP, DNS, FTP)
- **VPN**: Site-to-Site IPSec tunnel for secure HQ ↔ Branch traffic
- **Management**: SSH access allowed only from Management VLANs (HQ 192.168.60.0/24, Branch 172.16.60.0/24)
- **Inspection**: ICMP, FTP, DNS

---

## Protocols Implemented
- VLANs, Trunking, EtherChannel
- HSRP redundancy
- OSPF routing
- NAT, ACLs
- DHCP relay
- IPSec VPN
- SSH secured management
- DMZ with public services (Web, DNS, Email, FTP/NTP)

---

## Validation Tests
- Internet access from HQ VLANs and Branch VLANs
- VPN HQ ↔ Branch reachability
- Public access to DMZ servers
- NAT translation checks (`show xlate`)
- VPN session validation (`show crypto isakmp sa`, `show crypto ipsec sa`)
- HSRP failover tests
- DHCP assignment per VLAN
