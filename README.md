#  HQ–Branch Secure Network Lab (Cisco ASA, OSPF, IPSec VPN)

This repository contains a **Cisco Packet Tracer** lab simulating a secure HQ–Branch enterprise environment:

-  **Cisco ASA firewalls** (HQ & Branch)
-  **OSPF area 0** dynamic routing
-  **HSRP** core redundancy
-  **Spanning Tree Protocol (Rapid-PVST)** for loop prevention
-  **DMZ** at HQ with public servers
-  **NAT & ACL** policies
-  **Site-to-Site IPSec VPN**
-  **Dedicated DHCP servers** (HQ & Branch)
-  **SSH restricted to Management VLANs**

## Repository structure
- `topology/` – Network diagram (.png) and Packet Tracer file (.pkt)
- `documentation/` – Detailed technical docs (IP plan, NAT, ACL, OSPF, VPN, tests)

## Topology
![Topology](https://github.com/Silviu3369/HQ-Branch-Secure-Network/blob/main/Topology.PNG)

---

## Key Features
- HQ & Branch with **redundancy and security**
- **NAT/PAT** for Internet access
- **Static NAT + ACL** for DMZ servers
- **VPN IPSec IKEv1** between HQ & Branch
- **HSRP** on all VLANs (.1 virtual gateway)
- **SSH** allowed only from VLAN60 (Management)
- **Centralized DHCP** (HQ & Branch)
- **STP Enhancements**: Rapid-PVST, BPDU Guard, Root Guard

---

## Security Features Implemented
-  MOTD Banner for unauthorized access warning  
-  SSH as the only remote access method (Telnet disabled)  
-  ACLs for traffic filtering and access restriction  
-  DHCP Snooping on switches to prevent rogue DHCP attacks  
-  Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) to protect against ARP spoofing  
-  Port Security on access interfaces (MAC address limitation)  
-  Storm Control to protect against excessive broadcast/multicast traffic  
-  Spanning Tree Security: BPDU Guard & Root Guard  
-  NAT & PAT on ASA to hide internal networks and control traffic flows  
-  AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) with local users on ASA  

---

## Validation
- Ping HQ VLAN20 → Internet (8.8.8.8)
- VPN HQ ↔ Branch tests (`show crypto isakmp sa`, `show crypto ipsec sa`)
- Internet access from internal VLANs
- Public access to DMZ servers
- NAT/ACL validation (`show xlate`, `show access-list`)
- OSPF & HSRP neighbor checks
- DHCP relay tests on HQ & Branch VLANs
- STP loop-prevention and security checks
